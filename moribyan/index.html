        <h2>THE PASTA</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite pasta to use for this is penne! 
            However, you can really use any pasta shape you 
            like. Here are just some options I would go for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>rigatoni</li>
            <li>cellantani</li>
            <li>rotini</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>THE PUMPKIN SAUCE</h2>
        <p>
            If you are hesitant to try this recipe because 
            you can only imagine pumpkin puree in your 
            pumpkin spice latte and not in pasta, think 
            again! I think I might like pumpkin in savory 
            dishes over sweet ones now just because of this 
            one recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Here is everything you need for the sauce:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>unsalted butter</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>tomato paste</li>
            <li>pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>heavy cream</li>
            <li>parmesan</li>
            <li>sage</li>
            <li>nutmeg</li>
            <li>paprika</li>
            <li>onion powder</li>
            <li>red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Start by adding butter and oil to a pan over 
            medium-low heat. Cook the butter down for a few 
            minutes to brown it. This will add an extremely 
            nutty-rich flavor that pairs well with the 
            pumpkin puree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the butter is browned, add the garlic, 
            toast for a minute, and then add the tomato 
            paste. Cook the tomato paste down for 3 to 4 
            minutes to cut down the acidity. The tomato 
            paste will deepen in color. Now add the pumpkin 
            puree, whisk, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now add the heavy cream and the reserved 
            pasta water. Whisk again to have a smooth sauce. 
            Then it’s time to incorporate lots of flavor 
            with parmesan, nutmeg, paprika, sage, onion 
            powder, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. 
            Mix it all in, taste, and adjust anything to your 
            liking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Serve with more parmesan on top to enjoy!
        </p>

        <h2>VARIATIONS TO TRY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Instead of using canned pumpkin puree, roast 
                your own pumpkin to make your own puree. 
                The flavor will be ten times better! Here 
                are <a href="#">instructions</a> on how to 
                roast a pumpkin.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can omit the tomato paste or add less if 
                you want a more prominent pumpkin taste but 
                I like that it enhances the orange color!
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a sprinkle of brown sugar to the pumpkin 
                puree to bring out the sweet nutty flavor – 
                just a small sprinkle.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to add protein to this dish, you 
                can opt for ground beef, Italian turkey or 
                chicken sausage, or even chicken!
            </li>
        </ul>
