                            Today is the start of CMS week. We'll be going over
                            class policies and diving into CMS. By the end of 
                            class, you'll have created a blog post on your very
                            own website!

                            Panda diplomacy is the practice of sending giant
                            pandas from China to other countries as a tool of 
                            diplomacy and wildlife conservation. China also 
                            owns all the pandas in the world to exist and 
                            to yet be born except for one named Xinxin 
                            who was gifted to Mexico by China forever.
